PaySuper is a unique, simple payment toolkit designed to make developers self-reliant. It’s an open-source payment service 
with a highly customizable payment form, an intuitive API, and comprehensible, eye-catching reports.

Billing Server is a core and heart of all PaySuper for payment processing business logic. It designed to be mediator 
micro-service for [Management API](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-api) covering all REST API based 
interfaces for [dashboard](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-server) and [payment form](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-payment-form).

## Features

* A nice looking dashboard with graph and key metrics.
* Support for payment tokens and next payment without asking payment information.
* VAT/Sales tax calculating. 
* Payment Link feature.
* Detailed statistics for each transaction.
* Transparent payout calculation.  
* Reports like `Live Transaction`, `Country Distribution`, `Revenue By Client`, `Items Sales` and more to come.
* Export all reports to PDF, XLSX or CSV format.
* Customizable payment form.
* Recurring invoices (work in progress)  

# Getting Started 

Billing Server is designed to be cloud agnostic application. In general we use Kubernetes based installation to launch 
PaySuper in a dev environment cloud and AWS for production. 

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t paysuper_billing_service .
docker run -d -e "MONGO_HOST=127.0.0.1:27017" -e "MONGO_DB="paysuper" ... e="CACHE_PROJECT_PAYMENT_METHOD_TIMEOUT=600" paysuper_billing_service
```

## Starting the app

Billing Server application can be started in 2 modes:

* as microservice, to maintain rates requests from other components of system. This mode does not requests any rates
* as console app, to run the tasks, that passed as command line argument

Console mode can be used with cron schedule.

To start app in console mode you must set `-task` flag in command line to one of these values:

- `vat_reports` - to update vat reports data. This task must be run every day, at the end of day.
- `royalty_reports` - to build royalty reports for merchants. This task must be run once on a week.
- `royalty_reports_accept` - to auto-accept toyalty reports. This task must be run daily.

Notice: for `vat-reports` task you may pass an report date (from past only!) for that you need get an report. 
Date passed as `date` parameter, in YYYY-MM-DD format 

Example: `$ paysuper-billing-server.exe -task=vat_reports -date="2018-12-31"` runs VAT reports calculation for 
last day of December, 2018.

To run application as microservice simply don't pass any flags to command line :)
